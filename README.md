# EcoDhaga-ThriftEXR
An AR application using Unity where users can download our app, enter and scan their environment, place our virtual trial room in their environment, and walk through the room checking out different 3D models of clothes available on Ecodhaga's website.

This application is built by Poorva (@PmS-crypto) and Shardul (@FreSauce) as part of XROS fellowship at EcoDhaga
The application is built on Unity.
