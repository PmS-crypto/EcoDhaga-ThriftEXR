# EcoDhaga-ThriftEXR
An AR application using Unity where users can download our app, enter and scan their environment, place our virtual trial room in their environment, and walk through the room checking out different 3D models of clothes available on Ecodhaga's website.

This application is built by EcoDhaga fellows as part of the XROS fellowship at EcoDhaga.
The application is built using Unity.

Here are few preview screenshots of the app's AR environment -
